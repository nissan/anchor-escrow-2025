# Phase 1 Status Report ‚Äî Ticketfair Escrow Program Implementation

This document provides the current status of Phase 1 development for the Ticketfair platform, outlining completed work, in-progress tasks, and remaining items before deployment.

## Current Status (as of May 18, 2025)

### Completed ‚úÖ

1. **Core Architecture**
   - Base escrow contract successfully refactored for Ticketfair
   - All account structures defined and documented
   - Program modules and instruction handlers scaffolded

2. **Account Structures**
   - `Event`: Complete with Dutch auction parameters, status tracking, and cNFT asset ID storage
   - `Bid`: Complete with bidder info, amount, and status tracking
   - `Ticket`: Complete with ownership, status, and cNFT asset ID reference
   - `User`: Complete with basic user activity tracking

3. **Instructions**
   - `create_event`: Implemented with proper validation
   - `place_bid`: Implemented with Dutch auction pricing logic
   - `award_ticket`: Structure implemented with placeholders for Bubblegum integration
   - `refund_bid`: Implemented with partial/full refund logic
   - `create_user`: Basic implementation

4. **Testing**
   - Basic Rust unit tests written for core functionality
   - Test helpers and utilities in place

5. **Development Infrastructure**
   - Feature flags set up for phased implementation
   - Build systems working properly

### In Progress ‚è≥

1. **Bubblegum Integration**
   - Framework and structure in place
   - Feature flag ready
   - Placeholder implementations for cNFT operations
   - Resolving dependency conflicts

2. **Testing**
   - Unit tests need expansion
   - Integration tests with local validator need completion

### Remaining Items üîç

1. **Bubblegum Final Integration**
   - Resolve dependency issues for actual integration
   - Complete CPI calls for mint, transfer, and burn operations
   - Implement asset ID tracking

2. **TypeScript Client & Tests**
   - Develop TypeScript tests for all TicketFair instructions
   - Generate client library from IDL

3. **Deployment & Validation**
   - Test deployment on localnet
   - Prepare for devnet deployment
   - Document deployment process

4. **Documentation**
   - Update account interactions diagram
   - Document new error codes with troubleshooting steps
   - Finalize API documentation

## Deployment Readiness Checklist

Before deploying to devnet or mainnet, ensure:

- [ ] All unit tests pass consistently
- [ ] Integration tests complete successfully on localnet
- [ ] TypeScript client can interact with all program instructions
- [ ] Bubblegum integration is fully tested or has proper fallbacks
- [ ] Deployment scripts and parameters are documented
- [ ] Security review completed (prioritize PDA authority and fund handling)

## Next Steps

1. Complete TypeScript tests for the core TicketFair functionality
2. Test deployment with Anchor on a local validator
3. Finalize Bubblegum integration or plan for Phase 1.5 integration
4. Update TODOs to reflect current status and remaining tasks

## Notes

- The current codebase builds successfully with feature flags
- Core auction functionality works without requiring Bubblegum integration
- We're following a phased approach with incremental feature additions
- Current implementation prioritizes correctness and security over optimization
