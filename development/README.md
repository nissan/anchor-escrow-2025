## 📚 Key Development Documents

### Deployment Guides
- **[DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)** - General deployment instructions
- **[DEVNET-DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEVNET-DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Devnet-specific deployment
- **[LOCAL-DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/LOCAL-DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Local development setup

### Testing Documentation
- **[TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md)** - Comprehensive testing strategy
- **[TEST-FIXES-SUMMARY.md](docs/TEST-FIXES-SUMMARY.md)** - Test improvements and fixes

### Progress Tracking
- **[WORK-SUMMARY.md](docs/WORK-SUMMARY.md)** - Overall development progress
- Individual phase status documents in each `phases/phaseN/` directory

## 🛠 Development Workflow

### 1. Phase Planning
Each development phase follows a structured approach:
1. **Phase Overview** - High-level goals and scope
2. **Detailed Plan** - Technical requirements and implementation steps
3. **Status Tracking** - Progress monitoring and milestone tracking
4. **Testing Strategy** - Quality assurance approach
5. **Completion Report** - Final deliverables and lessons learned

### 2. Documentation Standards
- All major features require comprehensive documentation
- Testing strategies must be documented before implementation
- Progress is tracked in phase-specific status files
- Lessons learned are captured in completion reports

### 3. Quality Assurance
- All code changes require corresponding tests
- Documentation must be updated with implementation changes
- Deployment procedures are validated on devnet before mainnet
- Security considerations are documented and reviewed

## 🎯 Current Status

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅
**Status: Complete**
- All core functionality implemented and tested
- Comprehensive test suite with >95% reliability
- Successful devnet deployment and validation
- Complete documentation and deployment guides

### Phase 2: Switchboard VRF Integration 🚧
**Status: Planning**
- Requirements analysis complete
- Technical architecture in design
- Integration patterns being evaluated
- Timeline: Q2 2025

## 📋 Getting Started with Development
